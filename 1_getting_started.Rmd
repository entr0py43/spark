# Install sparklyr + Spark

```{r, eval=F}
# run this once
install.packages("sparklyr")
library(sparklyr)
spark_install(version = "2.3.0")
```

# Initialize Spark

Can also do this from the Connections tab in RStudio. You may need to install Java if you don't already have it.

Do this at the top of every script/notebook.

```{r}
library(sparklyr)
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")
```

The `master` argument will be different if you are running against a real Spark cluster: http://spark.rstudio.com/examples/
